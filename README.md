# Recipes
## Requirements
- iOS 17.0+
- Swift 5.9

## Architecture Overview
- SwiftUI-based application designed using the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecture for scalability, modularity, and testability. 
- Implements Repository Pattern for abstracting data sources (API + SwiftData) and Factory Pattern for dependency injection.
- Uses SwiftData for local persistence and async/await for concurrency.

## Approches
1. MVVM-C Architecture: Implemented MVVM-C using async/await.
2. Modular Design: Created separate modules for Network (API interactions) and DataStore (local persistence using SwiftData).
3. Recipe List Pagination: Data is fetched from the API with pagination, which is integrated into the scrolling list for seamless user experience.
4. Model Layers: 
- DTO (Data Transfer Objects): Used only in the repository layer.
- SD Model(SwiftData model): Designed for local persistence.
- Domain Model: Used in the service layer for business logic.
- View-Specific Model: Used in the view layer for rendering UI.
5. Coordinator for Navigation: Coordinator pattern is used for managing navigation flow.

## limitations
1. I have used the same image for both the thumbnail and detail views. In a real scenario, I would resize the image for the thumbnail and save it separately, making it more efficient to decode and render.
2. Due to time constraints, I used simple Git commit messages. However, in a real work environment, I follow proper commit conventions, use feature branches, and submit pull requests (PRs). I prefer maintaining develop and master branches, but for this project, I committed directly to main.
3. Pending unit test cases.
4. SwiftData migration has not been implemented.
5. UI test cases are not covered, but I have included UI testing using Previews and snapshot testing.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements
1. During final testing, I noticed a couple of issues that may require further investigation. Given more time, I would refine data handling and optimize UI updates to ensure the best user experience. These improvements would be prioritised in a production environment.
2. Accessibility features are not included.

## Data storage
1. SDRecipe → Has a one-to-many relationship with SDUserRating.
2. SDPagination → Manages pagination data.
3. SDUserRatings → Not yet integrated with the UI.

## Modules
1. RecipeNetworking: Provides a simple, reusable API wrapper around the network back end, facilitating data retrieval. It abstracts the complexity of networking and parsing, offering a clean interface for developers to interact with API endpoints.
2. RecipeDataStore: Provides a simple, reusable wrapper for data persistence, enabling efficient data saving and retrieval. It abstracts the complexities of data storage, offering a clean interface for developers to interact with data generated by the RecipeNetworking module.
3. RecipeDomain: Provides bridge between RecipeNetworking and RecipeDataStore. It avoiding teh circular dependency.

## Known issues/observations
1. Pending Accessibility/VoiceOver support, DynamicType increase.
2. No dark mode support.
3. Unit test cases, UI test cases.
4. The app are still monolith. Pending task: add RecipeUI and RecipeFlow module: Contains feature-level logic for listing, viewing, and (later) searching recipes. The internal structure is organized by sub-features (RecipeList, RecipeDetail, etc.) to support future modularization (e.g. when feature complexity or team size increases).
